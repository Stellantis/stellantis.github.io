# TECHNOLOGIES

Here are some information about webportal standards that you need to understand theses web technologies to develop webportal APPs.

- **HTML**: structure your APP content. See [W3C](https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/htmlcss)
- **CSS**: manage presentation of your APP.
- **JavaScript**: interact with the user and with the infotainment system.
    - `window.postMessage`: throught this JavaScript native API you will be able to interact with webportal vehicle APIs as explained in [Get-Started]({{site.baseurl}}/webportal/v1/quickstart/get-started/#article)
- **JSON** Serialization format: along with `window.postMessage`. JSON allows you to interact with webportal API.
- **MQTT** protocol: understanding MQTT protocol is mandatory in case you need a back-end for your App (in order to interact with vehicles through Groupe PSA MQTT broker). If you don't need any back-end, MQTT knowledge is not mandatory.
